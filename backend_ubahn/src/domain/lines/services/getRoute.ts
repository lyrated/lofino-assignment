/**
 * returns the `Route` from `originStation` to `destinationStation`.
 * If there are multiple possible routes, you can return any of those routes.
 *
 * You can assume `allLines` to be the sample data included in this project, which means you can make the following assumptions:
 *  - all stations are interconnected, so it should always be possible to find a valid Route.
 *  - there's a finite set of stations with a size of around ~100
 *
 * @returns a structure like e.g.
 * ```json
 * [{
 *   "action": "enter",
 *   "station": "OtisstraÃŸe",
 *   "line": (U6)
 * }, {
 *   "action": "switch",
 *   "station": "Leopoldplatz",
 *   "line": (U9)
 *  }, {
 *   "action": "exit",
 *   "station": "Hansaplatz",
 *   "line": (U9)
 *  }]
 * ```
